Just as I said initially, most of the research in my field uses inbuilt R analysis packages. My desire to learn R is for my advantage and because the world is moving to data driven world. For this class, I was able to source experimental data from another Ph.D. Student who has data on a fungus that ruined the tomato farm I was managing back in my country. I will be using this data as my project.
This work is on Fusarium wilt disease in tomatoes. Fusarium wilt is devastating soil-born fungal disease of tomato throughout the United States and worldwide (Li 2021). It is caused by Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. lycopersici which can result in high yield losses of tomato production in greenhouse, high tunnel, and field (Li 2021). 
The experiment was conducted to screen 12 tomato lines for resistance to Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. lycopersici race 4 that causes fusarium wilt disease. The plants were artificially inoculated 2 weeks after sowing. The disease severity was taken 4 weeks after inoculation. A rating of 1-4 was used, with 1 being the healthiest and 4 being the least healthy, including dead plants.
%Healthy was calculated by taking a percentage of plants with 1 score to the total. The experiment was replicated 4 times using a randomized complete block design. Each line contains 8 plants per rep; hence, there are 32 plants in total. 
The independent variable is "Trial ID" and the dependent variable is "%healthiness".
