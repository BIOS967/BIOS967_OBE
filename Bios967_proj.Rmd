# Exercise: Make this document
## David A. OBE

Let's see if you can make a document that looks *exactly like this* using **R Markdown**. Try to copy this document verbatim. Set the output to "html_document".

## 1. Insert this plot from the iris dataset
Here, I want you to insert a plot of three species of iris from the iris dataset.
```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(Sepal.Length~Species, data=iris)
```
## 2. Conduct and report the reseults of an analysis
We can conduct a linear regression between the speed of a car and the distance it takes for the car to stop. This data is available in a dataset called cars that is pre-installed in R.
```{r}
head(cars)
```
## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
